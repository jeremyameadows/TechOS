This feature will allow the user to create a new process by entering the name, class, priority, and the path of the desired file of the new process. The syntax for this command would be "create pcb". After the call, the user can expect to be asked to enter previously mentioned values of process name, process class, process priority, and desired file. If any of these fields are invalid, the user will be alerted of these invalid entries.
